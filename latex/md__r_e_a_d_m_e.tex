In this project, we implemented a simulator that evaluates the performance of CSMA protocols in a wired network.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Tests}{Tests}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
In order to test the functionality of our CSMA simulator, we created five tests to confirm correctness of our program. We created a .sh (tests.\+sh) script that ran these tests, and compared the "{}output.\+txt"{} file to the expected output file for that test. If they were identical, it would print out a passed message and if they were different, it would print out a failed message. This helped us debug our program.

To run our tests, you can run ./tests.sh from the terminal.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Test 1\+:}{Test 1\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md3}
This was the default test given in the Notion file. We used this to confirm that our initial implementation was correct and also that our .sh script was working correctly.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Test 2\+:}{Test 2\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
This was a test to ensure that consecutive packets could be sent on the same node. In the above test there was never a case where consecutive packets were sent, so we wanted to ensure that this functionality was working.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Test 3\+:}{Test 3\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
This was a test to ensure that the collisions were working correctly by incrementing R on a collision.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Test 4\+:}{Test 4\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
This was a test to test the maximum retransmission attempt, M, to ensure that the R value was reset and the packet was dropped if the maximum retransmission attempt M was reached.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Test 5\+:}{Test 5\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
This was a test to make sure that packets could be sent on a singular node for the entire duration T.
